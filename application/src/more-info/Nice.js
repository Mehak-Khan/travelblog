          "The town itself had a really relaxed vibe, perfect for slowing down and just enjoying the moment. Spending time at the beach was fun, and the mix of pebbly shorelines with that turquoise water made for such a unique scene.",
          "That said, I only actually spent one full day exploring Nice itself. The other two days were dedicated to day trips‚Äîone to glamorous Monaco, and another to the charming towns of √àze and Villefranche-sur-Mer. These quick escapes added so much variety to the trip and made the C√¥te d‚ÄôAzur experience even richer.",
          "Overall, Nice was a perfect base for exploring the French Riviera. Between the chilled seaside atmosphere, the postcard-worthy viewpoints, and easy access to nearby gems, it was the ideal 3-day getaway."

The reception staff also weren‚Äôt very friendly, and I‚Äôm fairly certain there was even a curfew around 3 AM, which felt restrictive for a hostel.
